\title{
Fourier Coefficient based distance. 
}
\description{
Computes the distance between a pair of numerical series based on their Discrete Fourier Transforms.
}

\usage{
fourierDistance(x, y, n = (floor(length(x) / 2) + 1))
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{
  Numeric vector containing the first time series.
}

  \item{y}{
  Numeric vector containing the second time series.
}

  \item{n}{
  Positive integer that represents the number of Fourier Coefficients to consider.
  ( default=(floor(length(x) / 2) + 1) )
}
}

\details{
The Euclidean distance between the first \code{n} Fourier coefficients of series \code{x} and \code{y} is computed. The series must have the same length. Furthermore, \code{n} should not be larger than the length of the series.


}

\value{
\item{d}{
   The computed distance between the pair of series.
}
