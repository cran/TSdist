\title{
Edit Distance with Real Penalty (ERP). 
}
\description{
Computes the Edit Distance with Real Penalty between a pair of 
numeric time series.
}
\usage{
erpDistance(x, y, g, sigma)
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{
  Numeric vector containing the first time series.
}
  \item{y}{
  Numeric vector containing the second time series.
}

\item{g}{
  The reference value used to penalize gaps.
}
\item{sigma}{
  If desired, a Sakoe-Chiba windowing contraint can be added by specifying 
  a positive integer representing the window size.
}

\details{
The basic Edit Distance with Real Penalty between two numeric series is calculated. Unlike other edit based distances included in this package, this distance is a metric and fulfills the triangle inequality.

The idea is to search for the minimal path in a distance matrix that describes the mapping between the two series. This distance matrix is built by using the Euclidean distance. However, unlike DTW, this distance permits gaps or sequences of points that are not matched with any other point. These gaps will be penalized  based on the distance of the unmatched points from a reference value \eqn{g}.

As with other edit based distances, the length of \code{x} and \code{y} may be different.

Furthermore, if desired, a temporal constraint may be added to the ERP
distance. In this package, only the most basic windowing function, introduced 
by H.Sakoe and S.Chiba (1978), is implemented. This function sets a band around the main diagonal of the distance matrix and avoids the matching of the points that are farther in time than a specified \eqn{\sigma}. 

The size of the window must be a positive integer value, not larger than the size of both of the series. Furthermore, the following condition must be fulfilled:

\deqn{|length(x)-length(y)| < sigma}
