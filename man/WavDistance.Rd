\title{
Dissimilarity for Time Series Based on Wavelet Feature Extraction
}

\description{
Provides the dissimilarity between two numerical series of the same length by calculating
the Euclidean distance between the wavelet coefficients obtained from an orthogonal wavelet transform of the series. 
}

\usage{
WavDistance(x, y, ...)
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{
  Numeric vector containing the first time series.
}

  \item{y}{
  Numeric vector containing the second time series.
}

  \item{...}{
   Additional parameters for the function. See  \code{\link[TSclust]{diss.DWT}} for more 
  information.
}
}

\details{
This is essentially a wrapper for the \code{\link[TSclust]{diss.DWT}} function of package \pkg{TSclust}. However, in this case, instead of introducing a matrix conformed of a set of time series, two numerical series of the same length are introduced.

\bold{Note:} This distance measure is based on the Euclidean distance. This means that it can be used directly within kernel machines, e.g. by inserting it in the Gaussian RBF kernel because it will provide positive definite Gram matrices. . 
}

\value{
\item{d}{
  The computed distance between the pair of series.
}
