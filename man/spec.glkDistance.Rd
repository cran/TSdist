\title{
Dissimilarity based on the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test
}
\description{
The dissimilarity of two numerical series of the same length is calculated based on an adaptation of the generalized likelihood ratio test.
}

\usage{
spec.glkDistance(x, y, ...)
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{
  Numeric vector containing the first time series.
}

  \item{y}{
  Numeric vector containing the second time series.
}

  \item{...}{
   Additional parameters for the function. See  \code{\link[TSclust]{diss.PER}} for more 
  information.
}
}

\details{

This function simply intends to be a wrapper for the \code{\link[TSclust]{diss.SPEC.GLK}} function of package \pkg{TSclust}. However, in the 1.2.3 version of the \pkg{TSclust} package we have found an error in the call to this function. As such, in this version, the more general \code{\link[TSclust]{diss}} function, designed for distance matrix calculations of time series databases, is used to calculate the spec.glk distance between two series. Once this bug is fixed in the original package, we will update our call procedure.

\value{
\item{d}{
  The computed distance between the pair of series.
}
