\title{
Short time series distance (STS). 
}
\description{
Computes the Short Time Series Distance between a pair of 
numeric time series.
}
\usage{
STSDistance(x, y, tx, ty)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
  Numeric vector containing the first time series.
}
  \item{y}{
  Numeric vector containing the second time series.
}
  \item{tx}{
  If not constant, a numeric vector that specifies the sampling index of series \code{x}.
}

\item{ty}{
  If not constant, a numeric vector that specifies the sampling index of series \code{y}.
}
}
\details{
The short time series distance between two series is designed specially for series with an equal but uneven sampling rate. However, it can also be used for time series with a constant sampling rate. It is calculated as follows:

\deqn{STS= \sqrt \sum (((y_{k+1} - y_{k}) / (tx_{k+1} - tx_{k}) - (x_{k+1} - x_{k}) / (ty_{k+1} - ty_{k}))^2)} 

where \eqn{N} is the length of series \eqn{x} and \eqn{y} and the summatory goes from 1 to one minus the length of the series. 

\code{tx} and \code{ty} must be positive and strictly increasing. Furthermore, the sampling rate in both indexes must be equal: 

\deqn{tx[k+1]-tx[k]=ty[k+1]-ty[k], \, \, \, for \, \, \, k=0 ,..., N-1}

%\bold{Note:} This distance measure is a metric (\enc{Möller}{Moller}-Levet et al., 2003). This means that it will provide positive definite Gram matrices and, thus, it can be used directly within kernel machines, for example by inserting it in the Gaussian RBF kernel (Lei and Sun, 2007).
