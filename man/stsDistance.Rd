\title{
Short time series distance (STS). 
}
\description{
Computes the Short Time Series Distance between a pair of 
numeric time series.
}
\usage{
stsDistance(x, y, tx, ty)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
  Numeric vector containing the first time series.
}
  \item{y}{
  Numeric vector containing the second time series.
}
  \item{tx}{
  If not constant, a numeric vector that specifies the sampling index of series \code{x}.
}

\item{ty}{
  If not constant, a numeric vector that specifies the sampling index of series \code{y}.
}
}
\details{
The short time series distance between two series is designed specially for series with an equal but uneven sampling rate. However, it can also be used for time series with a constant sampling rate. It is calculated as follows:

\deqn{STS= \sqrt \sum ((y_{k+1} - y_{k}) / (tx_{k+1} - tx_{k}) - (x_{k+1} - x_{k}) / (ty_{k+1} - ty_{k}))} 

where \eqn{N} is the length of series \eqn{x} and \eqn{y} and the summatory goes from 1 to the length of the series. 

\code{tx} and \code{ty} must be positive and strictly increasing. Furthermore, the sampling rate in both indexes must be equal: 

\deqn{tx[k+1]-tx[k]=ty[k+1]-ty[k], \, \, \, for \, \, \, k=0 ,..., N-1}
