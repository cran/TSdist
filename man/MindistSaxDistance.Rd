\title{
Symbolic Aggregate Aproximation based dissimilarity
}
\description{
Calculates the dissimilarity between two numerical series based on the distance between their SAX representations.
}

\usage{
MindistSaxDistance(x, y, w, ...)
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{
  Numeric vector containing the first time series.
}

  \item{y}{
  Numeric vector containing the second time series.
}

  \item{w}{
  The amount of equal sized windows that the series will be reduced to.
}

  \item{...}{
   Additional parameters for the function. See  \code{\link[TSclust]{diss.MINDIST.SAX}} for more 
  information.
}
}

\details{
This is simply a wrapper for the \code{\link[TSclust]{diss.MINDIST.SAX}} function of package \pkg{TSclust}. As such, all the functionalities of the \code{\link[TSclust]{diss.MINDIST.SAX}} function are also available when using this function. 

\bold{Note:} The negative definiteness of this distance measure is not explicitly mentioned in the literature, to the best of our knowledge, and so can not be assured. As such, when using it within kernel based classifiers such as Support Vector Machines or Gaussian Processes (i.e by inserting this distance in the Gaussian RBF kernel) the user should make sure that the obtained Gram matrix is positive semi-definite. More information and references to some solutions to this problem can be found in (Pree et al. 2014).

\value{
\item{d}{
