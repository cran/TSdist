\title{
Dissimilarities based on Pearson's correlation
}

\description{
Computes two different distance measure based on Pearson's correlation between a pair of
numeric time series of the same length.
}

\usage{
CorDistance(x, y, ...)
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{
  Numeric vector containing the first time series.
}

  \item{y}{
  Numeric vector containing the second time series.
}

  \item{...}{
   Additional parameters for the function. See  \code{\link[TSclust]{diss.COR}} for more 
  information.
}
}

\details{
This is simply a wrapper for the \code{\link[TSclust]{diss.COR}} function of package \pkg{TSclust}. As such, all the functionalities of the \code{\link[TSclust]{diss.COR}} function are also available when using this function. 

\bold{Note:} From the two variants of correlation based distances that can be calculated with this function, only one (denominated d1 in the documentation of \code{TSclust}) is a metric (Golay et al., 1998). As such, this first distance can be used directly within kernel machines, e.g. by inserting it in the Gaussian RBF kernel (Lei and Sun, 2007), because it will provide positive definite Gram matrices, which is a requirement for kernel based classifiers such as Support Vector Machines or Gaussian Processes. When using the second measure, since the negative definiteness is not mentioned explicitly in the literature, we recommend analyzing the Gram matrix before introducing it into kernel based classifiers. More information and some solutions to this problem can be found in (Pree, 2014)
